# Higher Order Functions :

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using each with a block
numbers.each { |num| puts "The number is #{num}" }
# Output :
The number is 1
The number is 2
The number is 3
The number is 4
The number is 5

# Using map with a block
doubled_numbers = numbers.map { |num| num * 2 }
puts doubled_numbers
# Output :
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
